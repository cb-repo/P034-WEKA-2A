<img src="assets/WEKA_Front.jpg" width="300"> <img src="assets/WEKA_Rear.jpg" width="300">

WEKA is a compact dual DC-motor ESC: originally designed for combat robots, but is suitable for any application requiring a lightweight durable motor driver.

Developed and tested in [Christchurch, New Zealand ](https://www.google.co.nz/maps/place/Christchurch+New+Zealand) by Connor Benton.

## FEATURES

- 2x Bi-Directional DC-motor outputs.
- Status LED's to indicate run mode, fault and calibration.
- Under-voltage, over-current, and over-temperature protections.
- Internal BEC to provide power to the radio reciever.
- Failsafe checks for loss of connection with radio.
- Calibrate function to customise drive mode, channel mapping, and channel inversion.
- Includes a 100nF capacitor across each motor to filter noise and voltage spikes.

## USAGE
### Status LEDs

There are 3 LEDs on the WEKA (1x red, 2x blue). The red LED is in the center and a blue LED on edge beside each output.
 - **Normal Operation**
    - **No Power** Red: OFF, 2x Blue: OFF
    - **Standby** Red: ON, 2x Blue: OFF
    - **Driving** Red: ON, 2x Blue: ON. Each blue LED will illuminate when their corresponsing motor output is being driven.
 - **Fault Conditions**
    - **Signal-Input** RED: ON, 2x Blue: ALTERNATING FLASH
    - **Under-Voltage** RED: ON, 2x Blue: FLASH (1Hz)
    - **Over-Temperature** RED: ON, 2x Blue: FAST FLASH (5Hz)
 - **Calibration** RED: ON, 2x Blue: PATTERN. (See Calibration section for specific LED patterns) 

### Fault Conditions

In all fault conditions the input signals are ignored and both drive outputs are stopped. 
Once the fault condition is resolved, functionality will resume immediately. 
 - **Under-Voltage:** An under-voltage event occurs if the battery voltage falls below 3.1V (per cell). 
 - **Over-Temperature:** An over-temperature event occurs when the temperature sense circuit reaches 100°C.
 - **Signal-Input:** A signal-input fault occurs if either S1 or S2 inputs from the radio is lost. *Note: You still need to set the failsafe on the radio reciever to handle a loss of connection between the reciever and transmitter*.

### Calibration
###### Calibration Parameters

The WEKA has a number of parameters that are auto-detected during the calibration process. These are:

- **Driving Mode:**
    - Tank (Each input controls a different motor)
    - Arcade (One input controls both motor speeds and the second controls steering) 
- **Input Mapping:**
    - Any input channel can control any output.
    - eg: Using Arcade mode, the throttle channel from the radio can be soldered to either S1 or S2 on the WEKA, and vice-versa for the steering.  
- **Input Inversion:**
    - Any input channel can be reversed.
    - eg: No resoldering the motor wires or reversing the signal in radio.

The default calibration parameters from factory are:
- **Driving Mode:** ARCADE
- **Signal Mapping:** 
    - Signal 1 = Throttle 
    - Signal 2 = Steering
- **Input Inversion:**
    - Signal 1 = OFF
    - Signal 2 = OFF

###### Calibration Procedure

 1. Install the motors in the robot, in the orientation you want to use them. *This will allow auto-detection of the input mapping and inversion during the following Simon-says process.*

 2. Connect the radio reciever and motors to the WEKA. *Ensure the transmitter has been bound to the radio reciever prior to continuing calibration*.

 3. The following Simon-says calibration requires the motors rotate... if the wheels are touching the ground it will drive. So prepare your robot/setup to allow this.

 4. Turn WEKA ON and, within 10 seconds, trigger the calibration procedure by:
    - Wiggle any stick on the remote (that's connected to the WEKA) back and forward 20 times. 
    Make sure to push the stick from CENTER all the way to MAX/MIN when wiggling. 

 5. Both blue LEDs will pulse 10 times and then stay fully illumintaed to indicated the WEKA has entered CALIBRATION mode and is ready to begin. *The rest of the calibration happens pretty quickly so please read step 6 before proceeding*.

 6. To start, push any stick on the transmitter to MAX and back to CENTER. Both blue LED's will subsequently turn OFF.
    - Two tests are run back-to-back. Each test will twitch both motors and cause the robot to move forward, reverse, left, or right. 
    The user must then input that motion back into the remote. eg:
        - Robot twitches forward: Tank drive, simualtaneously push both sticks forward. Arcarde drive, push one stick forward.
        - Robot twitches left: Tank drive, simualtaneously push left stick back and right forward. Arade drive, push one stick left
    - The process for each test is:
        1. Both blue LED's turn OFF
        2. The motors twitch
        3. One blue LED turns ON
        4. User presses input(s) to MAX/MIN
        5. Second blue LED turns ON 
        6. User returns input(s) back to CENTER
        7. Both LED's pulse 3 times to indicate success
        8. Repeat for second test

 9. Calibration Complete
     - Both blue LEDs will pulse 10 times to indicate a successfull calibration.
     - Once the LED pulses are complete, the WEKA immediately enters Run mode with the new calibration.
     - If the WEKA is turned OFF before completing the calibration process, NONE of the new parameters are stored and it will revert to the previous configuraion.
